        <h3>My Career Story Summary</h3>
        <p>I started my career with America First Credit Union and worked my way up in the company. After several years, I realized that I didn't like what
            I was doing and set out to find a new career path. A friend mentioned to me that her husband attended DevMountain and now has a great job that he loves.
            She had mentioned this to me a few years ago but at the time it wasn't really doable for me. However, I was now in a position to make the change and 
            alter my career course trajectory.
        </p>
        <p>Coding has always been something I enjoyed doing. I took a few classes in college and really enjoyed them but didn't pursue it for my career at the time.
            I found out that it was mostly because I wasn't dedicating enough time to learning how to code. I had other classes along with my full time job keeping
            me busy as well. That is one thing that was so appealing about DevMountain. It allows me to put all my focus on learning how to code! While it might be
            a little stressful not having a job at the moment, it's worth it when I can spend my full time concentrating on learning software development
        </p>
        <p>At the moment, I'm honestly not quite sure what exactly I want to do for my career but I do know I'm in the right place to figure that out. I want to be
            in the tech world and DevMountain has given me the first steps to getting there. I want to be a developer in one form or another and I suspect as I go 
            through the course at DevMountain, I will be able to narrow down what I want to do within the tech industry and be able to look for jobs from there.
            It's an exciting time to have the future so open as to what I can do and become, whereas before I felt like I was stuck and didn't have a future where
            I was at.
